This repository is an attempt at archiving all the coursework I have completed during my pursuit for a Bachelor's in Software Engineering at ASU. Top-level folders will organize content by semesters. Semester level folders will contain class folders, which will in turn contain coursework content.

Please note that earlier courses might have content not properly archived. To address this, each semester folder will contain a readme outlining every course I have taken during that semester.
