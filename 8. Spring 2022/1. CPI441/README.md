CPI441 was the culminating capstone course in the Computer Gaming Certificate. I, along with four other students, worked together to plan, design, implement, test, and deploy our own game project over the course of one semester. We also gave weekly progress reports on the game's development. I contributed heavily to the player movement of the game as well as documentation and the trailer.
