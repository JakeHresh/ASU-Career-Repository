SER493 was the second half of my Honors Creative Project with Barrett, The Honors College. In collaboration with Professor Ruben Acuna and Professor John Hentges, I made a first-person arcade game that tasks the player with punching incoming hazards. The game is built in Unreal Engine 4. In addition, I wrote a 73-page thesis describing the game's development, analyzing the tools and processes used, and speculating on what can be improved for a future build of the game. In addition to this repository, the paper can be found at the following link:

Unfortunately, the Unreal Engine project is too large to be hosted on this GitHub repository. Fortunately, it is already being hosted on an Azure DevOps repository. This can be accessed with the following link:

To download a build of the game, navigate to Repos -> Files -> ProjectBuilds. In the Files section, you will also see a README explaining the project.

Please feel free to explore the taskboards of the project as well.
